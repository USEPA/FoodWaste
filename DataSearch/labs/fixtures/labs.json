Externally, CompTox partners with academic centers funded by the Science to Achieve Results program and with a wide-range of organizations with an interest in using computational toxicology to screen chemicals for potential toxicity. Some of these partners include industry, trade associations, state and local government, universities and other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nEPA\u2019s CompTox Program is part of the broader Chemical Safety for Sustainability Research Program. CompTox is researching ways to address several longstanding difficulties with managing the safety of chemicals, particularly in assessing chemicals for potential risk to human health and the environment. CompTox conducts innovative research that integrates advances in molecular biology, chemistry and computer science to more effectively and efficiently rank chemicals based on risk.\r\n",

This includes determining whether an attack has happened, characterizing the extent of its impacts, controlling contamination, assessing and communicating risks, getting useful information to first responders and safely disposing of clean-up materials. While we're not on the front lines like those agencies or EPA's own first responders, we do have a critical role to play. EPA's National Homeland Security Research Program conducts research covering chemical, biological and radiological contamination under laws such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, the 2002 Bioterrorism Act, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and several Presidential Directives.",
