This is an automated email reminder from ORD QA TRACK to you as a research notebook custodian or contributor to schedule a review of the notebook listed above with your QA Manager. Your QA Manager and supervisor/mentor are also copied on this email.

<b>If you have already scheduled a review but it has not been completed yet, no action is required.</b>

If you would like a different notebook reviewed, please indicate that below.

The notebook review will determine if ORD policies related to scientific recordkeeping are being followed.  Scientific recordkeeping policies are described in the ORD Policy and Procedure Manual in Chapter 13 QA; <a href="https://intranet.ord.epa.gov/about-ord/section-1302-paper-laboratory-records">Section 13.02 Scientific Recordkeeping: Paper</a> and guidance in (if applicable) <a href="https://intranet.ord.epa.gov/about-ord/section-1306-scientific-recordkeeping-electronic">Section 13.06 Scientific Recordkeeping: Electronic</a>. In addition, your L/C/O may have additional recordkeeping requirements.

You as the custodian or contributor should also determine the status of the notebook: active, inactive, to be archived for QA purposes (i.e., this is not archiving associated with records management requirements).

If you are the notebook custodian or contributor, please use this email to inform your QA Manager about the status of the notebook requiring review, as follows:

1. Click on "Forward" from the action buttons at the top of this email.
2. Move to the "To:" field and enter the name of your QA Manager.
3. Put your cursor back in the area of the original email.
4. Type an "X" in the column with the most appropriate response for the Notebook.
5. Indicate if you'd like a different notebook reviewed.
6. State your preferred date/time for a review.
7. Click on "Send" from the action buttons at the top of the email.

Your QA Manager will now be able to better assist you with your notebook recordkeeping practices.
