    "the_description": "EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is a leader in the science of human health and ecological risk assessment, a process used to determine how pollutants or other stressors may impact human health and the environment. The center occupies a critical position in EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development (ORD) between researchers in other parts of ORD and outside of EPA who are generating new findings and data and the regulators in EPA\u2019s program and regional offices who must make regulatory, enforcement, and remedial action decisions. \r\n\r\nNCEA addresses the needs of stakeholders by preparing technical reports and assessments that integrate and evaluate the most up-to-date research. These products serve as a major component of the scientific foundation supporting EPA's regulations and policies. NCEA also conducts cutting-edge research to develop innovative quantitative risk assessment methods and tools that help extrapolate between experimental data and real-world scenarios, improve our understanding of uncertainties, and facilitate careful weighing of evidence. NCEA is often called upon to help risk assessors evaluate the effects of exposure during natural disasters, man-made events, and other population impact situations. NCEA's work is part of ORD's National Research Programs, including:\r\n\r\n    Air, Climate, and Energy (ACE) Research Program\r\n        Biofuels and the Environment\r\n        Global Change Impacts and Adaptation\r\n    Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) Research Program\r\n        Nanomaterial Environmental Assessments - sunscreen and disinfectant spray\r\n    Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) Research Program\r\n        Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) - chemical assessments\r\n            Risk Assessment 101 - guidelines, models, methods and databases\r\n            Children's Health\r\n            Diesel Exhaust Report (2002)\r\n            Second Hand Smoke Report (1992)\r\n            World Trade Center (2007)\r\n        Integrated Science Assessments (ISA) - air quality assessments\r\n        Exposure Factors Program - human health assessments\r\n        HERO database of studies EPA uses to develop risk assessments\r\n    Safe and Sustainable Water Resources (SSWR) Research Program\r\n        Causal Analysis/Diagnosis Decision Information System (CADDIS)\r\n        Global Change Impacts and Adaptation\r\n        Karst Termininology\r\n        Mountaintop Mining - Bristol Bay Assessment (2012)\r\n        Watershed and other place-based risk assessments\r\n    Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) Research Program\r\n        Report on the Environment (ROE)\r\n",
