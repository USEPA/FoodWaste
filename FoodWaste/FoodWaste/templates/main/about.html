    The following checklist summarizes QAPP requirements for projects involving
    Secondary Data or Existing Data and     Information. More comprehensive
    guidance on developing QAPPs for research projects is provided in the
    EPA-240-R-02-009 report titled Guidance for Quality Assurance Project
    Plans EPA QA G-5. The completed checklist     will be entered into QA
    Track with the approved QAPP by the QA Manager when final. The work on
    this project has been approved under the CESER QMP K-LRTD-0032360-QM-1-0
    and QAPP K-LRTD-0032360-QP-1-0.

<h3>A.3 Distribution List</h3>
<p>
    Quality Assurance Project Plans and Standard Operating Procedures shall be
    controlled through documented approvals as required by Section 5.3 of the
    Office of Research and Development Quality Management Plan. The project
    lead will be responsible for distribution of the current signed approved
    version of the QA Project Plan to project participants shown in Section
    A.4. Signed approved versions of SOPs will be available to project staff
    through the ORD@Work SOP intranet site. Signature approved electronic
    copies of this QA Project Plan, SOPs, and any associated QA assessment
    reports, will also be maintained in ORD QA Track. The project lead will be
    responsible for timely communications with all involved participants and
    will retain copies of all management reports, memoranda, and correspondence
    between research task personnel.
</p>
<!--Need to be able to add an organizational chart see QA Template docs folder-->
<h3>A.4 Project/Task Organization</h3>
<p>
    Identify the individuals and organizations participating in the research
    and discuss their specific roles and responsibilities. Include and all
    persons responsible for implementation. QA manager position must indicate
    independence from unit collecting/using data.  A table summarizing this
    information is recommended.
</p>

<h3>A.5 Problem Definition/Background</h3>
<p>
    State the specific problem to be solved, decision to be made, or outcome to
    be achieved. Include sufficient background information to provide a
    historical, scientific, and regulatory perspective for this particular
    project.
</p>

<h3>A.6 Project Description</h3>
<p>
    Provide a high-level discussion of how, when, and where the research effort
    will be conducted over the duration of the study.  Include any research
    questions or hypotheses, purpose objectives, any dependencies e.g., on
    other projects, certain funding levels, a certain measure of success at
    early stages of the project, etc., and any critical issues. This could
    optionally include information on potential impact or customer partner
    concerns. or equipment requirements. Provide an estimated timeline for
    completion of key tasks e.g., QA Project Plan and Health and Safety Plan
    development, data collect, etc. with respect to the target dates for the
    research project deliverables.
</p>

<h3>B.1 Data Acquisition and Collection</h3>
<p>
    Identify the secondary data needed to meet the research objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Describe how the existing data information will be used in the research
    effort e.g. augment or replace existing data information, verify or
    validate existing data information.
</p>
<p>
    Specify requirements relating to the type of data, the age of data,
    geographical representation, temporal representation, and technological
    representation, as applicable.
</p>
<p>
    Identify databases, maps and literature, and list as applicable to the
    research effort
    1 Information and data used to site or time sampling events meteorology,
    geology, etc.
    2 Anecdotal or other information triggering the study
    3 Toxicity, exposure, and environmental fate data
    4 Models and their output
    5 Census data
    6 GIS data.
</p>
<p>
    Identify any non-quality constraints on the secondary data information that
    affect its use in the research effort e.g., legal, programmatic, privacy
    confidentiality i.e., is it proprietary or CBI. If supporting an office,
    region or program check on applicability of the project decision, examples
    may include: CAA Credible Evidence Revisions FR 62:36, Feb. 24, 1997 or
    Federal Rule of Evidence 702.
</p>
<p>
<!------FIELD REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED IN APP------->
    <h3>B.2 Data Collection and Evaluation</h3>
<p>
    Identify the sources for the secondary data.  Describe the planning process
    for data gathering and how the project ensures that data or information
    collected are of sufficient quality to satisfy the needs of the research
    effort.
</p>
<p>
    Describe the process for acceptance rejection and inclusion exclusion of
    secondary data to support research objectives e.g., to exclude potential
    bias.
</p>
<p>
    Discuss the rationale for selecting the sources identified. If a hierarchy
    of sources exists for the gathering of secondary data, specify that
    hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
    Describe the procedures for determining the quality of the secondary data.
    Identify criteria for evaluating data or information quality e.g., using
    EPAs five General Assessment Factors or using measurement data criteria
    such as accuracy, precision, representativeness, completeness, and
    comparability. Note: Existing published data from sources such as
    governmental databases which have well-documented QA QC procedures may not
    require additional evaluation for quality.
</p>
<p>
    If the quality of the secondary data will not be evaluated by EPA, state
    this in the QAPP and require one of the following disclaimer statements to
    be added to any research product requiring clearance: EPA is distributing
    this information solely as a public service. Insert name of information
    source is responsible for the quality of this information. EPAs
    distribution of this information does not represent or imply endorsement by
    EPA. or The research presented was not performed or funded by EPA and was
    not subject to EPAs quality system requirements. The views expressed in
    this product are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the

<h3>B.3 Data Management and Documentation</h3>
<p>
    Describe the process for documenting and tracking sources used and the
    information that will be recorded for the secondary data collected e.g.
    data source, originating organization, report title, type of information,
    date.
</p>
<!------FIELD REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED IN APP------->
<h3>Existing Data Tracking</h3>
<p>
    Existing data sources are tracked and logged in CESER application Existing
    Data Search Tool https://134.67.216.106 under CESER
    QMP K-LRTD-0032360-QM-1-0 and QAPP K-LRTD-0032360-QP-1-0.
